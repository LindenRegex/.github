The Linden Regex project aims to take a new look at modern regexes.

- We work on new linear-time **algorithms** to match modern regex features.
- We design and mechanize the **semantics** of real-world regex languages.
- We write mechanized **proofs** of regex properties, and of the correctness of matching algorithms.
